1. INTRODUCTION

The Trust@FHH XACML PDP is a software component to evaluate incoming 
XACML [1] requests and generating proper XACML responses. It is based 
on the XACML implementation by Sun [2] and uses parts of the 
JBoss software [3]. It can be used to evaluate measurements of IMCs in
a TNC enhanced network and generate recommendations based on the responses.

2. INSTALLATION AND USING THE XACML PDP

- Binary archive
If you downloaded the binary archive, the Trust@FHH XACML PDP is ready to use,
just unpack the archive.
Then use start-jar.sh/bat to run the software. See section 3. for commandline
arguments.

- Source Archive
If you downloaded the source archive, unpack it and run ant with the provided
build file 'build.xml'.
Afterwards, use the delivered start.bat or start.sh scripts to run the software.

- GIT version
If you are using the GIT version, just run ant with the provided buildfile
'build.xml'

- Create binary and source archives
You can use ant with the 'make-package.xml'-buildfile to create a binary and
a source archive of the Trust@FHH XACML PDP.

3. COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

When you start the XACML PDP, you must specify the local port of the XACML PDP
as the first command line argument. Then you have to specify the time in 
milliseconds, after which the XACML PDP has to check for updates on the given 
policy directory. The third argument is the filename postfix for the policy 
files, and the last argument specifies the directory that holds the policy files.
$ sh ./start-jar.sh 12345 10000 xml conf/
Now the XACML PDP is running and evaluating incoming requests in separate 
threads. After the given amount of time, it checks for changes in the loaded 
policies and if there are new policies or if existing policies were deleted.

4. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

For additional information about using the XACML PDP in a TNC enhanced network,
or how to configure a TNC Server for XACML evaluation, please refer to the 
Trust@FHH research group's website [5] and wiki [4].

5. FEEDBACK

We really appreciate any feedback about the Trust@FHH XACML PDP. If you find 
bugs, feel free to report them via email to trust@f4-i.fh-hannover.de.

6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The Trust@FHH XACML PDP is implemented by the Trust@FHH research group of the 
Fachhochschule Hannvover, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts, located 
in Lower Saxony, Germany [6]. Parts of this work have been carried out within
the tNAC research project (support code 1704B08) which is funded by the german 
BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) [7].
